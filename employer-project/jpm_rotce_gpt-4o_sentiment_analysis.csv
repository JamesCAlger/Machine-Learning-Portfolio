"Hi. Apologies for prolonging the call. I just got this question a lot on Bloomberg from investors. Just wanted to re-ask the first question another way. It seems like we have been waiting for recalibration on the G-SIB for some time now. On the other hand, clearly, the expansion of your balance sheet comes with additional revenue generation and market share taking in some opportunities. And so investors are wondering if we don't get any sort of calibration that's meaningful and that CET1 floor does have to move up from 12%; what is the sensitivity of the normalized ROTCE outlook, if any at all, if that 12% does have to move up in 50-basis point increments?","Okay. So if the 12% has to move up, Erika, that would obviously have an impact, but there is so much between here and there and that being a reality that we can't really comment on it because not only – I know we've been waiting for G-SIB recalibration for a long time, but it has been made very clear that G-SIB recalibration will be part of the Basel III endgame, which we have also been waiting for, for a very long time. And so there will be potential offsets that we're unable to manage because we don't know what they are yet. So, we continue to wait for Basel III endgame. And then, as I said, we do believe we can manage the stress capital buffer. Again, it's scenario-dependent, but we do believe we can manage that to be closer to 2.5%, which helps an awful lot in terms of an offset to G-SIB constraints. So, we're thinking about that 12% number until we know something different. And I'll just add, we're going to fight like hell to keep the 12%, and we're pretty sure we can do it. So, I'm not that worried about it. But I don't know what the confusion is. If it did go up by – if we're earning 20% tangible equity and our capital goes up by 5% and we get no return on the 5%, our ROE goes to 19%. So, I don't understand the confusion. The underlying results are still fabulous and great, and yes, slightly lower returns. But I think it will be temporary. We will, over time, find strategies and tactics to get returns that are fair to our shareholders. But most importantly about those returns, we have great businesses, great branches, great products, great services, good margins, good service, good ops, good controls, and that's what we really build all the time. And this other stuff is just managing around capital constraints. It's a shame that this is – this is not the way to run a railroad anymore. We're spending time on this call on CECL and SLR, and it's a shame. And it does distract from growing the American economy. I've mentioned over and over. We have $2.2 trillion of deposits, $1 trillion of loans, $1.5 trillion of cash and marketable securities, much of which cannot be deployed to intermediate or lend.

"Hi. Good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you noted during a December conference that you believe that normalized ROTCE for JPMorgan would be about 17%. And investors are wondering, as we think about JPMorgan perhaps cementing a higher G-SIB surcharge at 4% this year, is 17% still achievable under that context or constraint?","Hi, Erika. Go ahead, Jenn. So, Erika, I'll start. So, just a couple of things to think about on capital. So, while we ended the year in the 4% bucket for G-SIB, and it's probably worth mentioning given the continued expansion of the system through the Fed balance sheet even staying in 4% could become challenging for us, but just a couple of things to keep in mind there is, we believe that we do have offsets in the Stress Capital Buffer, and we do believe that it's very possible that we'll see those come through in this round. Of course, it's dependent upon the Fed models, not our models, but we've talked about things that – actions that we've taken, sort of mechanical in nature in addition to moving investment securities into held-to-maturity that should give us some benefit on the SCB. Of course, that's scenario-dependent, but we do expect some benefit there that could offset. It's also important to remember that we still are waiting for the Basel III endgame, and the indication from the Fed is that they will address G- SIB recalibration as part of that. And so, it's quite possible that we see G-SIB recalibration, but perhaps another constraint that we'll be managing. So, there is a lot that we'll learn over probably the next year or two. And of course, the higher G-SIB doesn't come into effect until the first quarter of 2023. So, we do think we have offsets. We're still thinking about 12% as being a target CET1 for us - of course, given what we know today. But we are still waiting for that Basel III endgame to really understand what we're dealing with. And at that 12% in a more normalized environment, which wouldn't just be about rates, it would also be about loan demand, 17% still feels achievable for us.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jennifer Piepszak",2021Q1,29%,positive,0.9,positive,0.7

"Very clear. Thank you. My second compound question is on capital. If you could give us an update, I know that January 1 is the adoption date for SA-CCR. If you could give us an estimate on the impact to CET1 and just to clarify that 17% medium-term ROTCE does take into account that your G-SIB surcharge is 4.5%?","Yeah. So let me do the second one first. So in short, yes. So as I said in the script, we are not assuming any recalibration in that 17% target. So that does mean 4.5% G-SIB in the equity component of that number. In terms of SA-CCR, the impact of SA-CCR adoption was about $40 billion of standardized RWA, so I think if you do the math that's like 10 [sic] (30) basis points of CET1.",Erika Najarian,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q4,19%,positive,0.565,negative,0.515625
"Hey, good morning. So want to start off with a question on capital. Quarles highlighted in his swan song speech the potential for Basel IV implementation increasing capital requirements as much as 20% for select banks. While we haven't seen a formal proposal from the Fed, I was just hoping you could provide just some preliminary thoughts how you're handicapping the risk of higher RWA inflation ahead of Basel IV adoption, and to what extent is that contemplated in the updated ROTE guidance?","Yeah, so, Steve Don't give too much This is fine. It's a perfectly reasonable question. So, okay. So, here we go. So when you look at the current state of the so-called Basel III end game or Basel IV proposals, and you look at the RWA components of them in isolation, you've got the change in the credit conversion factors, which always equals a tailwind; you've got the fundamental review of the trading book, which is quite complicated and is going to depend institution by institution, but is potentially for some folks a headwind; and then you've got the introduction of operational risk capital into standardized RWA. 14Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. And if you look at sort of central case estimates of all those things in a simple way, you will conclude that there's a bunch of RWA inflation. But - couple things. First, this all takes place in the context of the global regulatory community, or at least in the US, saying that the system has enough capital. It doesn't actually need more capital. And it's important to realize Yeah. And so it's just important to realize, Steve, that as you know, obviously, there are additional tools. So the most important one of which is how the standardized output floors interact with the introduction of operational risk capital and to standardize RWA, and then in turn how that interacts potentially with the Collins floor, as well as more generally the fact that there are opportunities to tweak potential double counting and the stress capital buffer against FRTB and so on and so forth. So the point of all this is that there are more levers and tools here than just the overall RWA inflation, and the way we see the world, we don't expect the Basel III end game in and of itself to increase the dollars of capital that we need to carry as a company. And you were conservative in saying it's the 4.5% G-SIB. Exactly. And we are allowing the G-SIFI increases to flow through to the medium term ROTCE assumptions.",Steven Chubak,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2021Q4,19%,positive,0.7875,positive,0.611828
"That's helpful. And just double-clicking on something, Jamie, that you mentioned. You've talked about Venmo, Square, banks leaving the ground open for fintechs over the last few years. Just talk to us, to the extent you can, how these investments, clearly the market is focused on near-term expenses, ROTCE pressures, but talk to us two years or three years fast-forward, how do you feel about JPM as a franchise competing with big tech, fintech head-to-head?","Great. But it's battle engaged. I mean some of these people do a very good job. I think there's certain things we or banks should have done, so we should be a little self-critical, but we have the capability, the economies of scale and all these things. What we're not going to do is hamstring ourselves to meet an overhead target. That's just not even on the cards, so. And we have assets and strength. Look, competition is very bright. I mean they're bobbing and weaving. They're not changing, and they're not static. And I think sometimes people act like they're static, but they're not static, so. But if we do a good job like today on Consumer, I'm sure that’s all you Chase customers, free trading, lot of ATMs. You've got better and better service and more navigation bars, more offers, more travel, more rewards, more – and you've got more of that coming. And we've gotten friendlier in overdraft. We've gotten – and that's just one business. That's true for every single business. So I can look at it the other way around, too. If you're competing with JPMorgan, that could be pretty tough competition. Like take Chase UK. We've been very, very clear. And that costs us money, and a lot of you want payback tomorrow and stuff like that, we're not ready to disclose those numbers, but we are there for the long run. We're going to be adding products and services and countries for the rest of our lives. Okay? So I doubt, over the long run, we'll fail. We may not become the best digital bank in the UK or somewhere in the short run.",Ebrahim Poonawala,Jamie Dimon,2021Q4,19%,negative,0.52,positive,0.740735
"Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out here. It's a little frustrating, this call, because the guidance you've given has given all the bad news without any targets. I mean you're saying we have to wait two years for the 17% ROTCE despite the booming economy. You're guiding for the second year in a row of negative operating leverage. I get it, that's not how you run the company. But $15 billion of investments, that's up one- half over the last three years, and that $15 billion is enough to capitalize the 11th largest US bank. So I mean you gave us that, but you didn't tell us what to expect from all this investment in terms of what specific market share gains are you targeting, what specific revenues do you expect, when do you expect that. Can you put some more meat on the bones here because just at $5 billion of investment spend, look, it worked, you gained share. At $10 billion of investment spend, it worked, you gained share. But now you're going to $15 billion, and it might not always work so well. So can you, again, put more meat on the bones? The stock's down 5%. The feedback so far is like you're spending the rate hikes for investments over the next 10 years. That's great. You're in there for the long-term, but a lot of the investors aren't planning to invest in a 10-year horizon.","Michael, I feel your pain and your frustration. It is very possible in 2023 we'll have a 17% ROTCE. It depends on how we deploy our capital; it depends on fixed income markets; it depends on a bunch of stuff like that. So with the 400 branches that we're building, those things will get to contribution profitability just like we expect. The thousands of bankers we're adding in private banking and Chase Wealth Management we're pretty sure we'll get to breakeven just as we expect, but that takes a couple of years. And so, yeah, we're not going to tell you all of those things. And we already mentioned some of the tech stuff is just, kind of we have to do it and there's a little bit of bubble expense in that. There's even a little bit of bubble expense in the new headquarters and so we're pretty comfortable we're doing the right things, and we're being a little conservative. Like Jeremy was talking about the card stuff, the return. I told our folks that we're going to have card growth this year, but they were skeptical. The American consumer is very strong. Our products and services are very good. Chase, we call it now self-directed investing, has $55 billion. I think Robin Hood has $80 billion the last time I saw it or something like that. We're not sitting here bragging about our product because I would tell it's not good enough yet, but we've got $55 billion without us doing virtually anything or no marketing and no real stuff like that. So there's a lot of stuff coming. You know the competition we have to face. Some of these acquisitions we made will contribute to profit, maybe not exactly in 2022, but – and I mentioned the deployment of the balance sheet. We're pretty conservative with the deployment of the balance sheet. That may not always be true.",Mike Mayo,Jamie Dimon,2021Q4,19%,negative,0.535262,positive,0.623246

"Okay. And then just the follow up here is on the NII outlook where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side, and is it a couple of billion. And I guess the question I have is, historically you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You did that last cycle as well. What I'm hearing is that maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaining that at Investor Day. Is that a fair take away?","No, no, no. No. We don't look at it that way, like we're reinvesting NII. The investing stuff we look at all the time. We're investing a lot of money for the future kind of across the board. But that's not why he's saying – Yeah. I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We've talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about, at the time, some short-term headwinds to that mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%.

And I can think we do it without affecting our ROTCE targets and stuff like that. Obviously, it'll affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit and stuff like that.

"Well, good morning. I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful. So, I'm going to ask the question that I think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year. So, at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17% and that was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June. As we think about your capital build going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 17% ROTCE next year?","Yeah, this is obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So, we're very honest. We're not overearning on NII, maybe a little bit because of lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are overearning on credit. Think of credit card, the 1.5%, we've never seen a number that low. We're quite conscious of that. So, we don't brag about the 19% this quarter thinking that's going to continue forever. It's not. And obviously we may adjust that 17% a little bit, but it's not a material adjustment. We're going to find – we've got a lot of great bright people, and we're going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like CCAR and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisitions, for example, they were non-G-SIFI acquisitions. Non-capital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service-related. So, that's what we're going to do over time, and we're pretty comfortable that we'll get very good returns. So, yeah, we're quite – and next year is totally dependent on what happens in the environment. But the other thing I would look at, maybe we'll give you this number another time, is what would we earn in a recession. We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean, so I feel very good about that.",Erika Najarian,Jamie Dimon,2022Q3,18%,positive,0.6,positive,0.754497

"Okay. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan's stock has been around the capital charges, the capital margin, will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years. As you deliver on the positive operating leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital, obviously, and still hit those IRR and ROTCE targets on incremental investments. Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you're expecting to generate. And maybe that's an unfair question today and it's a better question for Investor Day, but that's kind of the debate that's out there on the stock.","I get it. I get it. I mean it's a fair question, it's a good question. I'm not going to answer it super specifically, and Jamie may have some views here, too. But let me just quickly say we've kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company's ability to generate 17% through the cycle, and that's incorporating our sense of the current environment, the operating leverage that you talked about, and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of 2024. The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is, of course, impossible to answer right now, but I would remind you that it's not just denominator expansion. Unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy which goes into the numerator, too. It's not what we want, but that is a possible outcome.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q4,20%,positive,0.70303,positive,0.667542
"And my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let's zoom out for a second here – to your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession, and I'm going to re-ask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind in NII and the headwind in the provision?","Yes, we can. But a lot of factors determine that. But yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession. Which, I think even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company – which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns, and we can still grow. And remember, 17% is very good if you can compound – some growth at 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I also want to point out we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point. And, Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So, as you know and as we discussed a lot through the pandemic, in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist central case forecast, which as you correctly say is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective. So we just want to be 6Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. clear about that.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2022Q4,20%,positive,0.756667,positive,0.749333

"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?","Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things. It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it. Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q1,23%,positive,0.6,positive,0.735147

"Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes down a bit, how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?","Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments, right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements early. So when we know the requirements and when we have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't be consequences to returns or to pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.",John McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,25%,positive,0.573468,positive,0.583302
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period. And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q2,25%,positive,0.739286,positive,0.769637
"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?","Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q3,22%,positive,0.633542,positive,0.628505

"Your 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?","I mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the RWA lands and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought 17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.",Mike Mayo,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,28%,neutral,1.0,positive,0.503849
"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?","Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",Matt O'Connor,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,28%,positive,0.626111,positive,0.626063
"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revisions to both Basel III Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And if so, just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward?","Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today. Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that question would be no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on ROTCE. If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17% through the cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator. And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually, like increase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed. So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory, not much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jamie made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference. So, maybe I'll just briefly summarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever-expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if. On the capital hierarchy, it's also worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intention to increase it to $1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital. And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quarter. And so, as we sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital. And as Jamie has said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",Steven Chubak,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,28%,positive,0.5125,positive,0.631806
