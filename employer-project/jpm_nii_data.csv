Management Commentary,Declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately $540 million on several legacy equity investments.,Management Commentary,Jeremy Barnum,2020Q4,13258
"So, I want to start off with a question on the NII outlook. The 2021 guide implies a rather healthy step-up versus the $54 billion, Jamie, that you had reiterated just last month. In your updated NII guide for 2021, what are you assuming regarding the deployment of excess liquidity given some of the recent curve steepening? And separately, what are your assumptions around the trajectory for card balances and overall growth in 2021, especially in light of the expectations for additional stimulus, which we saw at least this past year could drive further consumer deleveraging?","Sure. So, I'll start with excess liquidity. So, I think there the theme is we're being opportunistic but patient. So, as you think about the recent moves that we've seen in the yield curve, in the grand scheme of things, those could be small moves. And as we think about managing the balance sheet, it's not just about NII. Of course, it's about capital. And so, there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further sell-off. So, we're being very patient. But we have been and will continue to be optimistic and you will have seen that we did add $60 billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter. So, that's what we're assuming in the outlook, is a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity. And then And the implied curve. Yes, and the implied curve, yeah. And then on card balances, it is quite extraordinary what we're seeing in terms of payment rates in the card portfolio which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to deleverage. So, there is an offset in the – on credit line. But we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of 2021 as spend recovers. But it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated so that's why everything was put on that page in the plus-minus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk.",Steven Chubak,"Jamie Dimon, Jennifer A. Piepszak",2020Q4,13258
"Hi, Jenn. Given the outlook for net interest income and expenses, it seems like the efficiency ratio is going to tick up a few hundred basis points this year in 2021 versus 2020. And I know you don't manage it necessarily year-to-year but just kind of over time you seem to have a mid-50s efficiency target. Just kind of wondering how you put guardrails up for yourselves in terms of expense discipline and managing over time to have positive operating leverage and an efficiency corridor?","Sure. So, I'll start by saying you're absolutely right, we don't manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter, even any year, but operating leverage is very important to us. And then we gave, shared at Investor Day of about a 55% efficiency ratio. I'll say in a normalized environment, we haven't had anything that structurally has changed. And so, that should still be achievable for us in a normalized rate environment and otherwise normalized environment. And then as it relates to expense discipline, it is a bottom's-up process. And so, everywhere around this company we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that which is why I call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that isn't investments or volume and revenue related, it isn't necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiency. So, the discipline is everywhere and it's the way we run the company. And we do believe in the importance of operating leverage through time, no doubt.",John E. McDonald,Jennifer A. Piepszak,2020Q4,13258
"Okay. And then as a follow-up, on the NII walk, you've got $1 billion incremental NII expected in 2021 versus 2020 from Markets, CIB Markets. Can that be true if Markets revenues is down year-over-year? Can they both be true? And just maybe explain that.","Yes, it can absolutely be true. So, Markets is – I mean most of our businesses, we don't run them NII versus non-interest revenue, it is an accounting construct, but Markets it's particularly true. So, yes, that is possible. In NII, the Markets business, you can think about – it's liability- sensitive so you're going to see the benefit of lower rates in NII. That doesn't necessarily imply anything about the overall performance. 9We have positive carry. And trading profit goes down and the carry goes up. The number – the absolute number's the same.

"Okay. And then the follow-up I have, on your comments around the NII guide and the fact that it's hard to forecast, I got a couple of questions in this morning just on, hey, why do you think it's flat versus prior guide given the curve has steepened? And also, deposit growth should continue to be up significantly given QEs continuing this full year. So, is there some spread angle that you're kind of thinking about that keeps you a little bit more muted? Is it more the loan growth? Maybe you could talk a little bit about those piece parts that you identified.","Sure. I think it's probably all the above, Betsy. But starting with the steepening of the yield curve, so if you look at the Earnings-at-Risk disclosure, we did see the benefit roughly in line with what that disclosure shows, which is, since we last guided on NII, we steepened probably 25, 30 basis points. So, that is incorporated in the outlook, but it is completely offset by the fact that we continue to see consumer behavior in Card in terms of higher payment rates. And we haven't started to see re-levering, as we were just talking about, even though spend has recovered. So, Card– the impacts of Card completely offsets the steepening of the yield curve. You also mentioned loan growth which is critically important to realizing the benefits of the steepening yield curve. And then, I would just mention, we have reflected in our outlook the fact that we have been patient on deploying further deposit growth into the securities portfolio in terms of duration. And then also, it's probably worth noting that the marginal benefit of further deposit growth is quite small given the fact that deployment opportunities are minimal. And so, you can think about them as being something less than 10 basis points because we do have pay rate above zero. So, it's something less than 10 basis points. So, the marginal deposit growth from here doesn't add a whole lot - in this environment anyway. Hi, Mike.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jennifer Piepszak,2021Q1,12889
"Sorry about that. I had a question about the impact that negative rates at the short end of the yield curve might have on your entity. Specifically, you touched a little bit on the IOER rate, and the overnight repo rate being raised. Would that have any impact on your Market- related NII if they had to raise by 5 basis points? Secondly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, is that incorporated into your $55 billion NII guidance? And then, thirdly, if we do get negative rates at the short end, does that have any implications for what loan demand might look like? Thank you. 15","Sure. So, I'll just start by saying, while we have seen repo go negative at times, it's been orderly, and so we don't expect short rates to be negative for any longer period. And we certainly haven't seen spikes, which is something you would worry about more. I think, with the amount of capacity in the money market complex and the fact that the Feds increased their RRP facility, now that facility is at zero, so that certainly is supportive of ensuring short rates don't go negative for any meaningful period of time. They also, obviously, could increase that. And then, for us, I would say not a meaningful impact because, obviously, we have 10 basis points of IOER as an option for us. But we do trade around it. I would just add; the why is far more important than the number. Like NII, obviously, like in trading, it goes in and out. But all things being equal – no. It just shows up in a different place. But if you go negative NII, because you're going back into a recession because there's a negative variant, that's a whole different issue than if it's a temporary timing thing. I would tell you we would expect rates to be moving up over time and we expect a rather healthy, very strong economy. Yes. And what we've seen so far on the short end is not unhealthy or something we're worried about. It's a dynamic of so much cash chasing the supply.",Charles Peabody,"Jamie Dimon, Jennifer Piepszak",2021Q1,12889

"Hey. Good morning. I just have a quick question. As we start to look out to forward rates and market kind of implying Fed moving somewhat in the near term or intermediate term, how are you guys thinking about deposit betas this cycle? And kind of what's included in your NII sensitivity, both on the consumer and commercial deposits? Thanks.","Sure, so So, I think the way to answer that is the betas have gamma, meaning they change over time. And we have our best guess in the number that Jenn gives you. So, obviously, the beta's going up all the time, and then it levels off. That's right. And so, the betas have gamma. Like, I'd say that you can think of it as being non-linear, meaning the beta for the first 100 basis points will be lower than the beta for the second and third increments of 100 basis points. And so, from here, on the retail side specifically, the first 100 basis points will be very valuable because there is a lower beta associated with it. So that's really where we see the benefit in NII with short rates in an environment with low loan growth. Hello.",Brian Kleinhanzl,"Jamie Dimon, Jennifer Piepszak",2021Q1,12889

"A question on NII if I could, and apologize if it's a little multi-faceted. So, even though we're getting some inflationary data and you're positively inclined on the economy, as rates fell , not sure if you want to opine why, but let's talk about why you kept the NII guide. I'm assuming because deposit growth is strong. Curious your thoughts on consumer payment rates staying at this elevated level, deposit growth staying at this elevated level. And then, most importantly, if you're managing the balance sheet any differently, meaning you had been slow playing putting money to work. Rates are even lower now. Are you still slow playing putting money to work? Appreciate it. Thanks.","Yeah, thanks, Glenn. All right. So, let's sort of take that in parts. So, in terms of our NII guidance, yeah, so we're reiterating $52.5 billion for the full year. So, just to take your deployment point first. Obviously, rates are a little bit lower. Long-end rates are a little bit lower; the curve has flattened a little bit since we provided that guidance. But when we provided that guidance, we were reasonably conservative in our deployment assumptions through the rest of the year. So, as a result of that, it's not really a meaningful factor sort of at the level of precision that we're talking about here. In terms of the Consumer side, as you say, obviously, it's really Card that's really going to be the big driver. So, you heard us talking about payment rates, and you see the sequential growth in Card loans. So, we do believe that the sort of acceleration and the pickup in spend is going to translate to, as I say, resumption of loan growth in Card. But we do think that pay rates are going to remain quite elevated at a minimum through the end of this year. So, as a result, we don't really see revolving interest-bearing balances increasing meaningfully this year. And so, as a result, that remains a headwind for the overall NII for this year, which is incorporated in the outlook.",Glenn Schorr,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q2,12741
"And then a quick follow-up, Jeremy, on expenses. You revised the fiscal year 2021 outlook upward a few times now. Could you give a little more detail on the business volumes and revenues that are driving this? And also, we hear a lot about inflation across the economy. Are we seeing broader inflation play a role in your company's expenses and outlook?","Yeah. So, couple of things there. So, yeah, as you note, we have revised up from $70 billion to $71 billion, and the biggest single driver there is volume and revenue-related expense. There It's just comp. It's comp, but it's other stuff too. 7The comp, we're going to be competitive in comp no matter what it takes, so just keep that in the back of your mind. It is a little bit of comp. It's also transaction-related volumes. It's also marketing expense in certain pockets. So, it's all the stuff that fits in the category of volume and revenue-related. And I think the point is, obviously, we're all a little bit focused on the NII headwinds right now. But from an NIR perspective across Markets, AWM, IB, CIB in general, and even pockets, Wealth Management and CCB, we're actually outperforming the revenue expectations that were built-in for our prior expense guidance. So, that's kind of the dynamic there. In terms of inflation, I would say that we're not seeing inflation in our actuals. But obviously, your guess is as good as mine in terms of the future. But it would be reasonable to assume that that's going to be a little bit of a challenge to a greater or lesser degree if the economy as a whole is in a slightly higher inflationary environment and we did probably include a little bit of that expectation in the $71 billion for this year.",John E. McDonald,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2021Q2,12741
"Hey, good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on the Card business. You had 7% quarter-over-quarter growth in balances, but I think your guidance was still a little cautious. Is that just being conservative? You're still not sure about the relationship between spend and balance growth? Or how do we think about the good quarter and sort of that cautious outlook?","Yeah. So, I wouldn't use the word conservative. We've tried very hard in our outlook to give you central case numbers. So, we're going to be wrong, but hopefully, we'll be wrong symmetrically. So, we really want to try hard to give you central case numbers that don't have baseless optimism or unnecessary conservatism in them. So, the point that you highlight, the sort of apparent disconnect between the sequential increase in Card loans and the relatively muted NII outlook is really just about pay rates. So, we continue to see very elevated pay rates by historical standards, really highly unusual, as a result of some of the themes that we called out in terms of the strength of the consumer balance sheet. So, as long as that's true and we're seeing sort of unusually low conversion of spend into revolving balances, that's going to be a little bit of an NII headwind until the consumer starts to re-lever, which we do think will happen. We just don't think it's likely to be a meaningful effect this year.",James Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q2,12741
"So I wanted to start off with just a follow-up question on Card NII. Jeremy, you did strike an optimistic tone on the higher spend trends and the potential for future NII tailwind as payment rates start to normalize. Just looking at the Card revenue rate, given there are another of inputs in that metric, I was hoping you could just help us isolate the potential NII benefit versus the current baseline from a normalization in payment rate. So, just the payment rate normalizing, what would be the incremental step-up in the quarterly NII run rate?","Okay. So there’s a lot of pieces in that question, Steven. So, first, let’s talk about the revenue rate. So, a couple things. So, in terms of the NII, we don’t really see a meaningful uptick in Card NII happening this year. Like you might maybe see a tiny bit of it sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter, but I think it’s going to be pretty hard to see. So I think you want to be thinking about that as a 2022 effect. I'm not going to get into guiding on revenue rate for 2022, and I will actually point out that we're in the market right now competing aggressively with some great offers. And I'm happy to say actually the client acquisition in Card is going great, and we're seeing great uptake on the offers. But that comes with a bit of elevated marketing expense. So, as I look out to next quarter, you might actually see a bit of a dip in the revenue rate just because of the way the accounting works there.",Steven Chubak,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q2,12741
"Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at your net interest margin in the quarter, obviously, it came under pressure. And if we assume – and I know this is a big assumption, but if we assume that rates don't really change from here over the next 6 to 12 months, the long end stays anchored where it is, at what point does the average yield in your average interest-earning assets start to stabilize or maybe go up because the new business that you're putting on equals or exceeds what's running off in terms of interest rates on the products that are coming off the balance sheet?","Yeah, good question, Gerard. So, I mean, I guess one way to think about your question is whether we basically think that NIM has hit the bottom in this quarter. And I think we've all learned the lesson that calling bottom is a very dangerous thing. And I would also point out, and I would direct you to, like, the last page of our supplement – I'm not going to give you a big speech on Markets NII, which is my favorite topic, and why that is really sort of a distraction that we shouldn't look at. Maybe we'll do that next quarter. But we do have that disclosure where we split out total NII and Markets NII, as well as NIM and excluding Markets. And the reason I raise that is that, yes, your overall mental model is not wrong. It's reasonable to think that NIM might stabilize around these levels, but it's noisy. And the Markets number is in there, and that's going to add noise. And also, I would say right now, there's an unusual amount of numerator/denominator-type effects. So, whatever winds up being true about the numerator, you also have quite a bit of volatility in the denominator there, which is one of the reasons that we, obviously, don't manage to that number, as you've heard us say before. But your overall frame sounds reasonable to me.",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q2,12741
"Very good. And then as a follow-up, and I may have misheard you, so correct me if I'm wrong. But I think you said that the higher level of noninterest expense, the outlook that is, was really driven by the improved outlook for noninterest income. Can you give us any color on that part of it, the outlook for noninterest income improvement?","Well, some of it's in actuals and some of it's in the outlook, but at a high level the point is simply that if you look at the mix of revenue across this company, we have some offsetting dynamics right now. We've got NII headwinds from the Consumer de-levering, as we discussed. But as you saw in this quarter's CIB and AWM results, we have exceptional performance in Banking and in Wealth Management. And even though Markets is down year-on-year, it's actually up significantly from what we expect higher",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q2,12741
"I had a couple questions. One was just on sinking through the outlook for NII like you indicated, $52.5 billion subject to market conditions. Can you just give us a sense as to how you're thinking about market conditions? What's the trigger point for being maybe better-than-expected versus coming down? And I ask in context of, I notice your securities book. You shifted a bunch from AFS to HTM, so it feels like, from that, you're waiting more for rates to move up materially before you would lean into that yield curve trade. But maybe you can give us a sense as to what that market conditions comment was referring to and how you're thinking about that.","Sure. So, let's go through that for a second. So, I said I wasn't going to give my big Markets NII speech until next quarter, but I can't resist. So, you talk about market conditions. The Markets NII component of that NII outlook includes things like the extent to which we have spec pools versus TBA, the extent to which we have futures versus cash in high-rate countries like Brazil, the growth in prime brokerage balances. The common theme across all of these is there are situations where you're deploying balance sheet in the Markets business to serve clients, and that's profitable deployment on a spread basis, but there's quite a bit of gross-up between the kind of non-derivative piece of it and the derivative or derivative-like piece of it, where the derivative piece of it doesn't have any NII and the non-derivative piece of it does. So, every unit of that sort of activity that you do creates a significant swing in the NII number, either up or down, with very little impact to the bottom line. Now, that's not the entirety of the Markets story. There are parts of the Markets business where we're actually doing more a I think she wants the market. Not the Markets No, I know, but part of the market dependent comment is the Markets business. I'll go to the other point in a second and I'm almost done with the speech. Anyway, you get the point. So, that's one point of fluctuation. But going to your other piece, so the AFS/HTM, and I think your implied question, which is basically what would make us want to deploy more into a higher rate environment. So, I will say that the AFS/HTM changes that you've seen are really just primarily about managing capital across the various constraints, while preserving the right level of flexibility to do deployment. But given the level of cash balances right now, the AFS/HTM isn't really a main constraint in terms of duration buys, and I think we have enough flexibility in there to do kind of short-end cash deployment tactically as we always do. 18So, to get to the punch line, it's kind of what we said before, which is we're bullish on the economy. We believe that that comes with higher inflation, and therefore higher rates, and in light of that, we're happy to be patient right now. When that actually changes and we decide to deploy more, you'll see it in future quarters. And just a simple way to think about it, the $52.5 billion other than the Markets business which goes up or down. If rates go up – you can see our earnings and risk disclosure – we will earn more NII. All things being equal – of course, they never are, but all things equal. And in addition to that, we can make decisions to deploy more money for more NII.",Betsy L. Graseck,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2021Q2,12741
"Yeah. Yeah. No, I totally get that.","And I don't want to correct anyone here, but I personally think you'll see it go up by the end of the year. Okay? I think we're conservative on that, because with all the spend and stuff like that. But we hate guessing. What I'd look at much more is how many cards you have, how much spend you have, how many happy customers do you have. NII will take care of itself.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jamie Dimon,2021Q2,12741
"You know it's interesting versus when you were at our conference, Jamie, it seems like the $52.5 billion is more a function of the curve, given the fact that Card did, it looks like, better than you had thought at that time in the middle of June based on your comments about spend being up so much. But the","Betsy, let me just – sorry to interrupt you, but let me just pick up on that point for a second, because I think someone else asked a similar question. But I would just remind you that we do see the very healthy sequential growth in Card loans on the back of spending. But the key issue is the revolve behavior. And so our view on that really hasn't changed. And we do see elevated pay rates as a result of the cash buffers, which remains kind of the consistent reason why we have a muted outlook for Card NII this year.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q2,12741
"Yeah. I wanted to ask that NII question a little bit differently. In reiterating your $52.5 billion guidance, you said there was potential for some variation or variability around that number. And I'm trying to understand where the greatest variation could come from. Is it in your loan growth expectations? Because I'm hearing that you really are not expecting much in the way of loan growth. Or is it in the shape of the yield curve because of the Fed's QE actions or words around taper? And talking about the yield curve, could you also talk a little bit about what's more important, the short end of the yield curve between Fed funds and the two-year or the long end? And in that conversation, also talk about the significant amount of liquidity that's about to hit the short end. Thanks.","There is a disclosure in the March 31 10-Q that shows earning at risk if rates go up 100 basis points, US dollar and non-US dollar of $7 billion if the whole curve goes up 100 basis points. Now, the $7 billion, some number like 4.5% or 5% is short rates versus long rates. The long rate number is cumulative. I would add every year. Every time you roll over, there's going to be slightly higher rate. That is the number. Okay? Obviously, loan growth will be loan growth. That's in the plus or minus. But the biggest thing is interest rates. Well, let me give you the variables, Charles, because it's kind of a reasonable question. So, I'll spare you my Markets NII speech, you heard it already. But that's obviously a big factor. Within Card, we are somewhat optimistic about loan growth. But just remember that that loan growth has to translate into revolve to drive NII. And so, if pay rates remain – as I said earlier, it's a central case forecast that reflects the recent experience, so we are forecasting elevated pay rates. But, of course, we could be wrong. It could be even more elevated than we are currently forecasting, so that would be a downside. And the opposite of that if we see the consumer re-levering starting a little bit sooner would create upside there. And then, there's the impact of deployment. So, we're staying patient right now. That means that we're not burning the steepness of the yield curve. And if that changes, that could create a little bit of upside. And then, there is always the tactical actions that we can take in the front end of the curve. Right now, those aren't very interesting, because IOER is above money market rates, which is a big part of the reason that you see RRP having so much uptake. But it's not going to change and there were opportunities in repo and so on, then that could help a little bit as part of our constant tactical deployment there, but that's not again our simple case.",Charles Peabody,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2021Q2,12741

"Good morning, Jeremy. Wanted to ask about the net interest income guidance for the year, it seems to imply a nice step up in NII for the fourth quarter to roughly $13.5 billion. Was wondering what do you expect to be the drivers of that sequential step up and would you see the fourth quarter NII as a good starting point for us to think about our 2022 NII forecast?","Yeah. John, good question and good calc there. It's true. That is quite a bit of sequential growth. If you do the math, it suggests about $350 million. And in reality, if you think about what we've been saying about the outlook for increased revolve and deployment and so on, the increase is non-intuitively high and so, just to explain, within that there are a couple factors. So one, there's actually a meaningful amount of markets NII growth between the third and the fourth quarter which in general we sort of encourage you to ignore and there's also some sequential increase in NII from PPP forgiveness contributing to the fourth quarter number. So if you strip those two out, you still see a little bit of modest growth which is a little bit more consistent I think with the overall story that we've been telling which is that the real acceleration in NII especially from higher Card revolve is a 2022 item. In that context, then, if you take that sort of lower number and think about annualizing that, I think it's fair to assume that that would be a sort of lower end estimate for the 2022 number in light of what we believe will happen in terms of especially Card revolve. But obviously we'll give you a little bit more color about 2022 on next quarter.",John E. McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q3,13080
"Hey. Good morning. Just first on loan growth, as you noted, Auto has been strong, Card's starting to show signs of life. But it looks like outside of acquisition finance, C&I still seems a little weak, and we've got ongoing supply chain issues. So as we think about the big picture, how are you seeing, I guess, loan demand trends playing out and what are you expecting as the next 12 months progresses?","Yeah. So let's go through loan growth because obviously that's one of the areas that everyone's interested in. So if we start with Card, which is obviously the one that's going to matter the most in terms of NII impact, as you said, we see some signs of life, and we believe that recovery is strongly underway, and it seems hopefully like delta is really fading. So that's going to help. If you just look forward just to the holiday season, we would expect to see normal seasonality and normal growth there. And the question really for Card, as we've talked about a lot, is whether that growth in spend and in Card outstandings translates into revolve. But as I noted in the prepared remarks, when we look inside the data and we look at the customers who have both deposit accounts with us and our Card customers and we look at those who would typically be the ones that are most inclined to revolve, we actually do see slightly faster spend down of the excess deposit balances there. So that makes us relatively optimistic about both the potential for Card outstandings to grow with higher spend but also for increased revolve and lower pay rates as we go into next year. It's going to take time obviously but that is the core view. In Home Lending, broadly, we expect that this quarter's trend with portfolio additions outpacing prepayments to continue. And then in C&I which you mentioned, just a reminder, right, that as you go to the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the size of the C&I customers, we're eager to lend to them as a key part of the franchise, but from a financial performance perspective that's more of an outcome rather than a goal. But we do, as I noted upfront, see a little bit of an uptick in utilization rates amongst smaller corporates. So that's kind of consistent with the theme that we've been seeing which is that the smaller you are and the less likely you are to have had – to have benefited from the wide- open capital markets the more likely you are to be borrowing. We do hear a lot about supply chain issues from that customer segment. So it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out. And then in CRE, we see quite a robust origination pipeline as we've sort of fully removed any pandemic-related credit pullbacks, and we're leaning into that. And we do expect to see a little bit of net loan growth going forward. And then finally, I would note that we do see some loan growth in markets, actually, and we generally discourage you from focusing too much on NII and loan growth within markets. But it is an indicator that there are some opportunities there that we're taking advantage of in the usual kind of nimble way that you would expect us to do in markets.",James Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q3,13080
"Good morning. So, Jeremy, you provided some helpful detail on the drivers of loan growth by category. Just looking ahead, is your expectation that loan growth begins to keep pace with GDP or economic growth? Or is there anything that would actually justify more meaningful acceleration in lending activity, whether it's just greater pent-up loan demand, normalization of the Card payment rates, or something else?","Good question, Steve. But I think you're sort of potentially leading me into giving fairly detailed loan growth guidance for 2022, which I am not really in a position to do. But let me see if I can answer this at a high level. I mean, we've talked a lot about spend, which we believe in, driving Card loans higher. So that's one piece. And the revolve story within that as a function of the spend down in cash buffers, especially in our revolver – the revolving segment of our customers. And obviously, as you know well, if you kind of think about our NII as the sum product of the NIM and the outstandings and the various loan categories, it is really disproportionately Card that drives things. In the meantime, if you move a little bit away from Consumer to the larger wholesale system, in a world where, even if tapering starts relatively soon, if that plays out over roughly eight months at $15 billion of decrease a month, you still, if you do the math, wind up with another $0.5 trillion of QE. So we are dealing with a system that has a lot of surplus liquidity. And so in that context, realistically, it's hard to imagine seeing a lot of wholesale loan growth, at a minimum, but frankly that's not really a big driver of performance for us. So I don't know if that helps, but it's a good question.",Steven Chubak,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q3,13080

"Hey, guys. Was hoping to follow up on the capacity to deploy liquidity. And I guess just to kind of lean in a little bit, if we look at the growth in deposits, I know some of them are kind of considered noncore, but take out the loan growth and the growth in securities book since COVID, you've got about an extra $500 billion of deposits. And how much of that do you think can be deployed into securities, and understanding that you expect loan growth to pick up so that will go to some, but is there a way to size that $500 billion capacity in terms of buying securities?","Yeah, so I think there's a lot of factors that play into what the deployment decision is in any given moment. Obviously, as you said, loan growth, but also, we always make these decisions on the long-term economic basis, not for the purpose of generating short-term NII. And so when you do that, you have to think about capital volatility, drawdowns, and frankly, whether or not you see value. And that, if anything, is probably the biggest single factor right now. As I talked about earlier, it is true that the market has come a little bit more in line with our views, at least from a rate perspective, and that may lead to a little bit more deployment, all else equal right now. But when you start talking about spread product, for example, in light of the liquidity environment that we're in the QE numbers that I mentioned a second ago, that remains very, very compressed and there's just not a lot of value there. So we're always – we always try to be long-term economically motivated there considering all the scenarios, considering risk management, considering the convexity of the balance sheet, and looking at value and being tactical there. So that's really how I would think about that.",Matt O'Connor,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q3,13080
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, and it's on page 16. And it's a two-part question on this guidance. The first is could you help us size the timing and magnitude of deposit data that you presume in the $50 billion number as well as the size of securities deployment? And the second part to that question is clearly we're missing that white box, right, in terms of CIB Markets contribution. And if you could give us sort of rails to think about CIB Markets in light of your comments about more modest normalization versus the idea that this business is naturally liability sensitive.","Right. Okay. So three questions in there. Let me take them one at a time. So beta, at the end of the day the reprice experience is going to be a function of the competitive environment. But for the purposes of working through the guidance, I can tell you that we're assuming that this hiking cycle is going to be generally similar to the prior hiking cycle, all else equal. The environment is a little bit different in some important respects. So, I think the system this time around is flushed with deposits, is flushed with liquidity in a way that it wasn't before, so that could at the margin make the reprice a little bit slower. On the other hand, the competitive environment is different especially with some of the neo bank entrants and that could go in the other direction. So it will be what it will be, but for the purposes of the guidance we're assuming a reprice experience that's similar to what we experienced in the prior cycle. In terms of deployment, obviously deployment is going to be a situational decision, but if you're looking at the $4 billion bar on page 16, securities deployment is a modest contributor to that $4 billion number. The bulk of it is the loan growth narrative, particularly in Card. And then in terms of Markets NII, the whole point of not guiding explicitly to Markets NII is to avoid getting distracted by the noise there, which can come from a lot of really kind of irrelevant places like interest rate hikes in Brazil and cash versus futures positions, which is the example I like to give. But big picture, if you need something for your model or whatever, there's a couple things we could suggest. So if you look at the supplement, we've actually been disclosing the Markets NII number for some time in the supplement. So you actually have a pretty decent time series of that number over time. If you regress that thing against the Fed funds rate, you'll actually see that there is a pretty clear negative correlation there, and so you can draw some conclusions from that. But I just will point out that like in any given moment, relatively small changes to the mix of the Markets balance sheet can really change the NII quite significantly even in an environment of no policy rate changes. So it's sort of like a health warning against putting too much emphasis on that projection.",Erika Najarian,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q4,13601
"Think so. And maybe if I can just ask a very general question. I think people get normalizing capital market and a higher investment spend and that has got you falling short of the 17% over time target. The question – the simple question I have is, is the fact that you mentioned multiyear shortfall, is that a function of timing of NII going full run rate with the timing of capital markets fall off and the higher denominator as you just mentioned with John's question?","So, Glenn, your line is breaking up a tiny bit, but I think I basically hear your question, and I think the simple answer is yes. So in other words, we're sort of saying that as the environment continues to normalize in a variety of ways, so that includes policy rate normalization, rate curve normalization, as well as run rate normalization in Markets revenues with the sort of some background expectation of growth there, Markets and Investment Banking revenues, with a background expectation of growth. And when all of that plays out, and is finished playing out, we believe we should be back to 17%, all else equal. So you can kind of see it's not that long if you know what I mean in terms of like what the current forwards imply about when you get back to a sort of more normalized policy rate environment. And, Glenn, I'd just like to add, we don't really know about 2023, and I'd be very cautious in that. Plus, I expect more interest rates increases in the implied curve. And obviously, the world's very competitive. I also want to point out that a 17% return on tangible equity, if we can get that for the rest of our lives, would be exceptional. Reconfirming that that's kind of what we think we can do is pretty good.",Glenn Schorr,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2021Q4,13601
"Okay. Second question is just on fees. There are couple of zigs and zags in mortgage banking, security servicing, which were both down a little bit more than expected and Card did get a little bit better. Can you just kind of give us a little bit of color on the drivers of each of those, please? Thank you.","Yeah, sure. So there's a lot of stuff in there. So let me do mortgage and Card. So in mortgage, you'll see that if you sort of try to do a margin calculation by taking the production revenue and dividing it and so on, you do see an apparently significant drop in margin there. So there's a few drivers of that. One is the margins were actually slightly elevated in the prior quarter as a result of the timing of the flow-through of the loan-specific pricing adjustments. So that's one factor. In addition, you actually – we did – despite the fact that it was an exceptionally strong overall quarter for originations and for funded loans, as we started to see higher rates towards the end of the quarter, we did see the dynamic that you would expect in terms of drop in saleable new lock volume, and so on. So that's little bit of a factor. And then there's this sort of the normal organic dynamics where you tend to see margin compression in mortgage with rates selling off a little bit. So you have a bunch of factors driving a slightly lower number there, but the overall mortgage environment is quite healthy. And obviously, with higher rates, we expect things to be weaker next year. We're still predicting a $3 trillion mortgage market next year, which by historical standards is very robust. So that's that part. And then in Card, I imagine that you're looking at the Card income line, where we had a significant drop last quarter, and this quarter the number is also sort of relatively depressed relative to what we had two quarters ago when it was quite high. So you'll remember that for Card income, we had a sort of one-off item last quarter depressing the number. This quarter we have another sort of one-offish type item, which is the impact of the Southwest co-brand renegotiation, which is public. So that's contributing to the Card income line and to the revenue rate a little bit. But it's important to note that in the background of all this is the impact of the customer acquisition amortization contra revenue expense, which as you know amortizes over 12 months. And so as I mentioned earlier, as part of the big sort of increase in customer engagement, as 10Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. part of the re-opening in the middle of the year, we ramped that up quite significantly, 100,000 point offers in the market, and stuff like that. And so that's coming through the number. So as a result, when you look at the sort of full-year revenue rate for Card of around 10%, we actually see that as a reasonable central case for next year, with the sort of elevated marketing and customer acquisition amortization being offset, obviously, by expected growth in NII with the revolve narrative that we've laid out. While we wait for the next question – yeah, sorry, no, go ahead, go ahead.",Ken Usdin,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q4,13601
"Right. That's the top one. Then just a follow-up on just on the NII, I think futures markets are now pricing in four hikes. I think you have three in your assumptions. If we do get four hikes starting in March, is that a material change to the NII outlook for this year in your models?","Yeah. So if you look at the bottom left-hand side of page 16, footnote 3, in extremely small print, you will notice that the implied curve that we use is from January 5th. So you can take that curve, and whatever the current curve is and use the table on the bottom right and add a long list of caveats that I won't give you and draw your own conclusions. But, I mean, it should be a modest increase, modest additional tailwind, very modest.",Jim Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q4,13601
"Okay. So a couple of questions, first, on the NII outlook, could you give us a sense as to what's embedded in that with regard to your thoughts on how balance sheet shrinkage at the Fed, right, the QT, is going to impact the liquidity pool, and then how much of that liquidity pool you currently are assuming is going to get redeployed into the more duration in your forward look?","Yeah. Sure. So, I mean, I forgot exactly what the market's assuming about the start of QT at this point, QT2 as they're now calling it. But from last time I looked closely, there was expected to be a pretty long lag between sort of the end of the hiking cycle and the beginning of QT2. Maybe people are now starting to accelerate that. But in any case, the important point is that as a result of the acceleration of tapering, the amount of balance sheet growth is ending pretty quickly, and therefore, the impact on system-wide deposit growth should be quite modest this year. And our assumptions are consistent with that. In other words, we're not assuming lots of deposit growth next year, because, ultimately, that's going to be primarily as a function of the Fed balance sheet size. But obviously, we are still assuming modest growth rather than reduction as a function of QT, if you know what I'm saying. And so then in terms of deployment, you can see in the supplement that we already did some deployment this quarter. It was primarily in the front of the curve. So we're still being quite cautious about really buying duration. But – and if you look at, again, page 16, you notice that we call out securities deployment as a modest driver of that $4 billion increase that's tagged as balance sheet growth and mix. So it's reasonable to assume that we might do a little bit of duration buying if the rate curve develops as the forwards predict. But it shouldn't be too dramatic.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q4,13601
"Okay. Thanks. And then my second question is just on the investments, the $3.5 billion that you've got incremental here. And I assume that this is built up bottoms up from business unit leaders' requests to do everything that you mentioned in the call. And my question here is, what percentage roughly, like just gut numbers, but what percentage are you giving them this year? In other words, did they ask for 7%, you're giving them 3.5%, and we should expect another uptick materially in 2023? I know, Jamie, you mentioned $77 billion is the run rate that we should grow from next year. But I'm kind of asking a slightly different question, which is how much of what they need are you giving them this year? And a subset question is, at what point does this fully fund your ability to get into the cloud for US consumer?","Okay. Can I answer that question. We do not sit at a table and tell people, you can only do X. We sit at a table and ask people what do you want to do. So think of it as it's 100% within our capability. Because some things we just simply can't do. You can't attack 14 funds at the same time or something like that. That's number one. So we want to make those kinds of investments, each one goes through kind of rigorous process as is necessary. Some of them are table stakes. I do remember sitting around the table one day and people talking about digital account opening and doing NPV. I was like just don't do an NPV, just get it done. It's like – that's just serving your client properly and stuff like that. And like I said a lot, I mean, Jeremy mentioned, it's 400 branches in the United States, it's 13 sites overseas, it's more countries, it's more products, it's all the things we should be doing that you'd want to do if you owned 100% of the company. So it may not be what you would do if you have to meet NII next quarter of X, Y, or Z or something like that, so And, Betsy, the only thing I want to add to that, which I was going to basically say the same thing, this whole like ask for 10 and hope to get 5, I mean, we would – we aim to manage the company much better than that. So I certainly don't have that type of authority. That's not the way it works. And I think the important point is that what actually happens is a ton of scrutiny of the investment agenda two or three levels down in the organization with a lot of discipline there. So, that's where the conversations happen about whether this makes sense to do now, whether it's the right priority now, whether we have the capacity to do it, whether in the cases where the returns are measurable, whether it's producing the right returns, and that's really part of how we operate the company and part of the discipline of the day-to-day. If I can give you another example, if we can spend $2 billion more and get to the cloud tomorrow, I would do that in a second.",Betsy L. Graseck,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2021Q4,13601
"Fair enough, Jamie. You certainly have the track record that supports that. Just for my follow-up on card payment normalization, how are you thinking about the trajectory for card payment rates? And just maybe to speak to your confidence level that we see card payment rates return to pre-pandemic levels just given the emerging threats from BNPL that you cited and still elevated personal savings rates?","Yeah. Sure. So I still, to be honest, get a little bit confused between payment rates and revolve rates and all these various ratios, but I think it's a little bit simpler if you just take a step back. You look at the revolve rate and you look at the overall level of revolving balances and what we sort of expect for that. 15Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. So there's a few things to note. So the revolve rate, having dropped quite a bit has more or less stabilized. There's a little bit of a blip in the fourth quarter as a function of holiday spend and maybe some Omicron stuff, but broadly, it's stabilized. In the meantime, the growth in overall card loans has now, for several quarters in a row, produced modest growth in revolving card balances. And our central case for next year basically assumes that that trend stays in place. So what's important about that is that we're not assuming some sort of aggressive return of the revolving rate to the pre-pandemic levels. We're simply assuming that it stabilizes and that overall card loan growth, therefore, contributes its fair share of revolving loan growth. And so the kind of central case that we put on the page for the balance sheet contribution to NII growth in 2022 has, very roughly speaking, revolving balances getting back to the pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, roughly.",Steven Chubak,Jeremy Barnum,2021Q4,13601

But that's not why he's saying – Yeah. I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We've talked a little bit over the last couple of quarters about, at the time, some short-term headwinds to that mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%.

So all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through which in general in the geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues as I've mentioned in the past. And so that's why we don't focus too much on that number.",John E.

Was wondering about the net interest income outlook, I know it sounds like we'll get more at Investor Day, but it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February and obviously rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of color and what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook?","Good morning, John. Good question. Yeah, look, obviously given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's getting priced into the front end of the curve, we would actually expect the excess part of in excess of $53 billion to be bigger than it was at a Credit Suisse. So to size that, probably a couple billion dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bottoms-up process. There have been very big moves and we want to get it right. And so we'll give more detail about that at Investor Day.",John E. McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q1,13872
"Okay. And then as a follow up, in terms of the updated NII outlook, you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about $66 billion at Investor Day. Just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate hikes you have assumed in your outlook.","Yeah, so the $66 billion number, if you want kind of to put a number in, you can use something like $68 billion, $68 billion plus, something like that. Obviously, we're annualizing one quarter, so there can always be noise in there, but that seems like a good number to us, that's consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question? 2023.",John E. McDonald,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2022Q2,15128
"Yeah, hey, guys. Good morning. Just a follow up on the points about managing the balance sheet and capital and RWAs. How do you think about your ability to manage that RWA output and dimensionalizing how, if at all, it might impact either the net income outcome or the ROTCE outcome as you look forward?","Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it. And I can think we do it without affecting our ROTCE targets and stuff like that. Obviously, it'll affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit and stuff like that. But all told, we're going to manage the hell out of it, and we'll be fine.",Ken Usdin,Jamie Dimon,2022Q2,15128
"Got it. Okay. That's a fair point. And then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit. Obviously, you've got the denominator increase in there too and spend versus lend. Can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath Card revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here? Thanks.","Yeah, sure. So on Card revenue rate, we'd said that we thought 10% was a reasonable number for the full year. And it's running a little bit lower right now, and I think the current level – look, what is it Mikael, 9.6% or something, is probably the right number for the full year at this 10Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer & Member-Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co. point. And really the difference is driven by a couple factors. The main one is that while the growth and revolve is basically still in place, our view that we would see normalization revolve balances happening towards early – beginning of next year, that – starting point of that did get slightly delayed by Omicron, by about six weeks. And so that, all else equal, is a little bit of a NII headwind relative to what we'd expected but still obviously very robust. Can I just add a little bit on because I know I'm harping on mortgage a little bit here but I just want to explain it. Because if you go to Europe, okay, the capital held against mortgages is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage that, and standardized risk weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So there are a lot of ways to manage it, and there's no securitization market today. So our view would change if there's a securitization market. We might do something different. But by not owning it, buying it, selling it, hedging it, swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk and returns. And so it's unfortunate, because I think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our client. Our job is to serve clients through thick or thin, good or bad, with what they need and how they need it, and now we spend all our time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements. Right. So yeah and just to finish on Card, so slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay and that slightly better-than-expected new client acquisition is a driver there. And then there are some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well.",Ken Usdin,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2022Q2,15128

"Hi. Just had a few follow-up questions. The first is on balance sheet management .Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on slide 3, does that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billion-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out non-operating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was there as well, please.","Yeah. Hey, Erika. Sure. So first point, you have to turn on your magnifying glass, but if you look at footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right at the end of there, it says assumes flat RWA in the projection. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be and you've heard Jamie's comments on that, but if you look at the table above, you see that you've got the usual moving parts. We've got organic loan growth that we want that's profitable on its own, or in part of important relationships that we'd like to see continue to happen. Some of it is a little bit passive. We can't really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like VaR. And then there's the mitigation piece of it, which we're going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I said before, on lower returning, lower client nexus, or both. So across those three bits, we'll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here. In terms of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall, looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that I said before and that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we'll see how it goes.",Erika Najarian,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q2,15128
"Yeah. I'm just curious in your guidance on NII where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate. Next year, do you factor in any impact from a possible treasury buyback program which could redirect liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system, and, therefore, keep your deposit betas lower? Do you think about that at all as a possibility?","Yes. I think I – I don't know if you were listening when I said it before. QT, net issuance of mortgages, net issuance of treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility, and absolutely we incorporate that on our thinking including lags, the change in the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you. And that's why we're trying to be conservative with NII, that while you can annualize the $19 billion to $76 billion, if you have a model, put in $74 billion, and it incorporates all of that.",Charles W. Peabody,Jamie Dimon,2022Q3,17518
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about your EaR disclosures, what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures. They look a little different than peers. And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you're liability sensitive. Can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the assumptions behind it?","Yeah. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. It's really all about lags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EaR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state. As you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this year. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from $50 billion at the beginning of the year to now $61.5 billion. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities to rate fluctuations, given the lag environment that we're in.",John E. McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q3,17518
"Well, good morning. I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful. So, I'm going to ask the question that I think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year. So, at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17% and that was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June. As we think about your capital build going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 17% ROTCE next year?","Yeah, this is obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So, we're very honest. We're not overearning on NII, maybe a little bit because of lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are overearning on credit. Think of credit card, the 1.5%, we've never seen a number that low. We're quite conscious of that. So, we don't brag about the 19% this quarter thinking that's going to continue forever. It's not. And obviously we may adjust that 17% a little bit, but it's not a material adjustment. We're going to find – we've got a lot of great bright people, and we're going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down, including like CCAR and SCB and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisitions, for example, they were non-G-SIFI acquisitions. Non-capital, non-G-SIFI, all services and service-related. So, that's what we're going to do over time, and we're pretty comfortable that we'll get very good returns. So, yeah, we're quite – and next year is totally dependent on what happens in the environment. But the other thing I would look at, maybe we'll give you this number another time, is what would we earn in a recession. We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean, so I feel very good about that.",Erika Najarian,Jamie Dimon,2022Q3,17518
"Thank you for that, Jamie. And this is a super-micro question as a follow-up for Jeremy. Why would Markets NII be zero next quarter, and should we expect that to be zero next year?","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. It's terrifically simple. We're financing the Markets businesses at the yield curve, so you're earning the same thing you’re paying to finance the trading book. Yeah, Erika, I mean, basically as rates go up, the funding cost goes up and the offsets on the other side, in many cases, were through derivatives or derivative-like instruments, so it goes through NIR. Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensitive. You can see that history through our disclosures this year. So, as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn't expect to see as many changes, at least from rates. Of course, we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased one way or the other. 9",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2022Q3,17518
"Hi. Thanks a lot. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie's comments there. Obviously, one of the toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta, so just starting to see it, it looks like, in terms of deposit costs starting to increase. So, how do you think about it now in this new environment where we might go to 4.5%, maybe higher, in terms of how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts? Thanks.","Yeah, thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Jenn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop, is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals. And the question is why is that? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably means that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles. So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point they will start to come out, obviously in wholesale, they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.",Ken Usdin,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q3,17518

"I wanted to understand a little bit about how you're thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked already about how it's hard to predict NII, obviously Markets has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about delivering operating leverage, where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested in so you really can't touch, and where there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker rev line you can still deliver positive operating leverage?","Sure. So, I mean, as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category that you're addressing is the volume- and revenue-related expense, which we highlight because it should, pretty symmetrically, respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage. So, for example, in this year's ultimate outcome and the number that we wound up printing for 2022, the year-on-year change in volume- and revenue-related expense, we're still refining the numbers, we'll probably show you more at Investor Day, but is probably close to $1 billion – in other words, year-on-year decline. Whereas next year we're assuming something more like flat. So, while the sort of year-on-year dollar change in the outlook sort of 2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually. And so, for example, if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that we're budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop in the volume- and revenue-related expense number that's in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest of it, we're always generating efficiency, and we've worked just as hard at that whether the revenue environment is good or bad. And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so, broadly, our investment plans really shouldn't be that sensitive to short-term changes in the environment. Of course, certain types of things like marketing investments in the Card business in particular, the math of what we expect the NPV of those things to be through the cycle may change in a downturn, and that could produce lower investment, all else equal. But the core strategic investments that we're making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of the environment.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q4,20192
"Sure. Okay. Let's drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So, if I heard you correctly, I think you are sort of talking about sequential increases in NII, so I guess looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe even 2Q. So, I guess we're hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop-off as, say, deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few Fed Fund rate cuts as well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?","Yeah, no. So, let me uncontroversially say no there, Andrew, just for the avoidance of doubt. So, look, my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which you are somewhat correctly drawing from the slide, which is that, in a world where we're exiting the fourth quarter run rate at $81 billion, or $80 billion ex Markets or whatever, and we're telling you $74 billion for the full year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We're simply saying don't project those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense?",Andrew Lim,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q4,20192

Can you help us understand what type of effects that has, if any, on parts of the income statement, whether it's NII or the Trading business?","Yeah. So, if I just take that one, just assume we're going to have modest growth in RWA and in every single business – mortgages, loans, derivatives – how we hedge CVA and stuff like that. We take actions to manage RWA. It does not really affect the business that much. It might one day, but it doesn't affect it today. 10Jamie Dimon A Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

"And my follow-up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let's zoom out for a second here – to your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession, and I'm going to re-ask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind in NII and the headwind in the provision?","Yes, we can. But a lot of factors determine that. But yes, we can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession. Which, I think even in a real recession, it would probably equal the average industrial company – which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns, and we can still grow. And remember, 17% is very good if you can compound – some growth at 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I also want to point out we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point. And, Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So, as you know and as we discussed a lot through the pandemic, in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist central case forecast, which as you correctly say is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective. So we just want to be 6Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. clear about that.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2022Q4,20192
"Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide, as you mentioned. It looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? Maybe you could give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes.","Sure, John. I mean, I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as you well know, can produce quite significant impacts on the NII. And also that there's, as we've already talked about, a meaningful range of possible outcomes for the year-ahead as the deposit reprice path remains uncertain. The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says, and the drivers within that are the usual drivers. In Wholesale, we would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition, especially of the non-operating type balances, and you're going to see some internal migration there out of non-interest- bearing into interest-bearing over time. In Consumer, CDs are flowing right now, and we're seeing good new CD production. We've got a 4% CD in the market as of this morning. And so continued CD production, and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it is – well, and, of course, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect – across the company – modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT and the rate cycle and so on. So we've got best guesses for all of those in the outlook, and of course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we'll just run the business this year.",John E. McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2022Q4,20192
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning, appreciate that there is a significant amount of uncertainty in this year's NII forecast in particular. But to follow up with John's question, I'm wondering if you could give us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you're expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit beta. I think the feedback I'm getting very early from investors is that they appreciate the headwinds that's occurring for NII this year. At the same time, you have been consistently beating what seemed like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion number in the fourth quarter. So that's why I think the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their own expectations are versus that. 5","Thanks, Erika. So, look, I totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we're trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year. I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely – and that's just a level of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we'll be faced with as a company are respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy, which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost. So, in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits, as I said. Jamie, you want to add something? Erika, I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider $74 billion conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced its balance sheet by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in T-bills, money market funds, and of course, banks are competing for the capital money now and banks are all in a different place. And some banks have started to compete heavily. Some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less. But if you look at prior – and forget what happened in 2016 – I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had zero rates. We've never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CDs, more migration to money market funds. A lot of people are there competing for it and we're going to have to change savings rates. We can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen. And I just also want to point out that even at $74 billion, we're earning quite good returns. We've always pointed out to you all that sometimes we're over-earning and sometimes we're under-earning. I would say, okay, this time we're over-earning on NII this quarter. We're maybe over- earning on credit. We may be under-earning on something else. So these are still very good numbers and we're going to wait and see and we'll report to you. But I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2022Q4,20192
"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You mentioned the Fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do the bank failures there that happened in March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it industry-wide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do those events influence your view of the reprice?","Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two answers to that. One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.",John McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q1,20711
"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium-term is going to happen of mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already reflects 5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JPMorgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in 2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve?","Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things. It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it. Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios. On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we're a bank. A very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very good returns – whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q1,20711
"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending, and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better loan spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing, why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.","Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out. And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.",Mike Mayo,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q1,20711
"All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yourself, I guess, with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?","Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store – you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes. And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that, and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second-guess that when it happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I saw the headline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them get through this. We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That does not mean it won't have problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of need. And we all did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, those who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I would expect people to do that going forward.",Mike Mayo,Jamie Dimon,2023Q1,20711

"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. And I guess, is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?","Yeah. So the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as we'd had pre-pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve per-account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier, we're seeing a higher yield there as well. So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage. We don't see that yet, so. It's normalization. Yeah. It's a good thing for us. Yeah.",Matt O'Connor,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q1,20711
Management Commentary,NII was $1.,Management Commentary,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q1,20711
"Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the forward curve, if I understand correctly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.","Go ahead, Jeremy. And then I'll go. Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it was pretty clear that we were very asset-sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the short-term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this level of rates, the relationship between our short-term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment. It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on this call – the competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve. So, that's why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quarters out, we know a little bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside baseball now – the number that we're talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range. And you're absolutely correct. You could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines.",Betsy L.

"I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10-Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity going from liability-sensitive to asset-sensitive, at least that's the way I read it. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.","Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle, we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases the EaR number about $4 billion from minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to something more like $2.5 billion.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And then secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think about the implications of higher-for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about?","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously, we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier, we don't consider this level of NII generation to be sustainable. And we talked previously about a sort of medium-term run rate in the mid-70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when that's going to happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point.",Jim Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your thoughts. So you earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is maybe above that 17% through-the-cycle rate when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any input on that would be great.","Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that when we talked about the 17% through-the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the company's ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, some of them could be bad. Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight-up math of simply diluting down the ROTCE by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of moving parts in there, but I think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment period. And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some which are very capital-intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over-earning on is credit. We've been over-earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to pick up just as it normalizes, considerably more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q2,21779
"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago?","Yeah. So, I mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super-positive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over-concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft-landing right now, no landing, immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even post-pandemic, so we're probably over-earning on credit a little bit. Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization. Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our prediction. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we don't know the outcome. We try to be really clear here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if those things could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.",Ebrahim H. Poonawala,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q2,21779
"Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not spend more if you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to do so? You have $10 billion more revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?","Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right?",Mike Mayo,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
"Wait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years, going back to it.","Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is through-the-cycle spending based on through-the-cycle investment, through-the-cycle spending based on our through-the-cycle view of the earnings-generating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to the bottom line, both when it's going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that recently. I don't see that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far. But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them don't.",Mike Mayo,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
"And then one quick follow-up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at some point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself against the low-cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you're getting closer?","Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to low-cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments that we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, but there definitely is room for improvement.",Mike Mayo,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
"Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark-to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward guide here, longer-term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10-Qs over the next four, five quarters, I should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be accelerating from here? I'm just trying to put those two things together.","Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through-the- cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock to the forward curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to recognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous, and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next 12 months relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
So then…,"All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q2,21779
"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow-up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid-$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least one quarter of $18 billion of NII so that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30-basis point 17Charles W. Peabody Q Analyst, Portales Partners LLC drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the impact is.","Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10-basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a consequence of migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether it's because savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars of deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be.",Charles W.

"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income. Fees might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years. So, I know you always say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years?","Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets. We saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control. And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are. So we're always very focused on cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle. But there are long-term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",Matt O'Connor,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q3,22726
Want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your comments in the press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to normalized next year or later on?,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really just trying to remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don't fundamentally think are sustainable. You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like, and we put a sort of mid-70s type number out there. And at Investor Day, we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about $80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out that it’s quite a bit lower than the current run rate.",Ryan Kenny,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q3,22726
"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segments, what really jumps out at us is the 40% ex-First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking.

But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're all supposed to pick away at everybody's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take that credit over-earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?","Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk about over-earning on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we've talked about. But, I would also point out sometimes we don't like the word over-earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs. And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a decade, two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are still there, and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q3,22726
"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non-interest-bearing deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre-pandemic. Is this expectation that you're going to see more of the non-interest-bearing deposits go into interest-bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest- bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?","Yeah. It's a good question, Gerard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but I'm not sure that the reported interest-bearing, non-interest-bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons. So first, like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non-interest-bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively low-rate paid to cross-checking and savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now. But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by internal migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest-bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system-wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future.",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q3,22726
"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re-asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the dynamics in higher-for- longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter?","Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex. Markets and we're kind of saying $22.5 billion. Yeah. Isn't that what I meant to say? She said $22.9 billion. Oh, I didn't hear that, okay. Anyway We didn’t model it that way. So call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to $80 billion, so that's one building block. Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesting actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get a little bit smoother, I would say, overall. So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and that's what sort of a long-term focus means for us. And I would just add quantitative tightening in there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect, where wholesale, consumer as – remember also the Fed has the RRP program which is also sucking money into the Fed directly and reducing deposits. That's still a trillion too.",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q3,22726
"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm curious to how much is the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that. And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one for Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark-to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted spending, your outlook for next year? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?","Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior point But the percent who are digital only is much lower than that. 14 For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycle, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously. So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I just think like it's sort of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a very technology-centric business, and the world is competitive, and everything is changing. Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise, we risk getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything. Just the competition, when we look at it, it's Wells, who's coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously Marcus, it's Apple, it's Chime, it's Dave. There are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful. It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are going to do and be very, very good at to protect the company.",Mike Mayo,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2023Q3,22726

"Just to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have NII ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the contribution from First Republic be down as well or up?","It's going to hit… the day we did it, so Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statement that I really don't want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in 2023, as a result of the impact of the NII of the pull to par of certain relatively short-dated assets that we fair-valued at a meaningful discount as part of the transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore, straight annualization is probably not the right way to think about it.

Management Commentary,"With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10.",Management Commentary,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q4,24051
"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have a full year in 2024 of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billion this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and then you also have a significant amount of adjustable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts, that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Republic be a much bigger contributor? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there.","Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this year is that while we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in order to improve period-on-period 12Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be Firmwide, including First Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise. Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro-validation one way or the other of some of your back-of-the-envelope math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And then, from a sensitivities perspective, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to the prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dynamics. And so, I think that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company.",Charles W. Peabody,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q4,24051
Management Commentary,"The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balances, partially offset by wider spreads on loans.",Management Commentary,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q4,24051
"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss your assumptions on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in deposits? How are you thinking about all that?","Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product-level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Wholesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing. And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted average rate paid, for example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six cuts. And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non-intuitive if you're kind of trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non-intuitive. And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down, which when you consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth in the system as a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system-wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to take share in deposits based on our customer value proposition across all of our different businesses.",Jim Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q4,24051
"Okay. And then, just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know it's complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful.","Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you know, we don't update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit lower. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1 billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that just because even though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been seeing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain asset-sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hopefully, that gives you enough to work with.",John McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q4,24051
Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlook that you've put out there?,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wouldn't exactly describe that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning. So, not particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I highlighted in the prepared remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiting below $88 billion and some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of marching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year.",Matt O’Connor,Jeremy Barnum,2023Q4,24051

"Okay. And just a follow-up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? Is it the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the biggest drivers of upside or downside.","Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter-end had roughly three cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is still a tailwind there. We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then, there's obviously the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to make those decisions situationally as a function of competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 billion of deposits paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error bands here are pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinking about the long- term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing.",Jim Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q1,23082
"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets NII, that outlook being revised down by $1 billion but revenue neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the idea would be the way you're structuring trades, the way the balance sheet is evolving, there’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower Markets NII, correct?","That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet in the financing businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in the supplement and these things are all related. So, fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non-interest- bearing, high-funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, no impact on NII. So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effectively neutral. It's second order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. And that's why we've been emphasizing for some time that the NII ex. Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing.",John McDonald,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q1,23082
"Hey. Good morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoughts on the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher-for-longer, maybe the economy is too strong so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers where the momentum is picking up? And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers.","I would say consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower-income folks is running out – not running out, but normalizing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher-income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So, whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a recession, they'll be in pretty good shape. Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up. But what I caution people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending, a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen. And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how much fiscal spending will actually take place, our elections, et cetera. So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side. How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so, everything is okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outcomes, which we are. And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario, which is the generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong. You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these numbers change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happening is higher than other people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in the economy, literally in my life or in history.",Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Jamie Dimon,2024Q1,23082
"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as written, you earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that 17% through-the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over-earning today?","Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over-earning, right? So, obviously, one major area is that we're over-earning in deposit margin, especially in consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. So, I think that's probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess earnings currently. You also have heard Jamie say that we're over-earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge-offs have been particularly low, but we have builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And in Card, of course, while charge-offs are now close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge-offs being very low by historical standards, although that was coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over-earning narrative. Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thinking about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital” and so on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in light of potential updates of the Basel III Endgame, given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see through the Basel III Endgame. At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much more to say except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in absolute terms, very good in relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwind.",Erika Najarian,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q1,23082
"Got it. And just as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale.

As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cuts out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that would","Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if you want to do math for like the changes of the average funds rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest, it's like as good as an approach as any. But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small changes there can make a big difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, we want to make sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going to be.

"Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list? And what would cause you to end the overearning narrative?","No. Actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more than that, that's one very simple way to look at that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the overearning narrative.",Mike Mayo,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746
"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful perspective. Maybe just for my follow-up on NII, you've been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds. In the second quarter, we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak 4Steven Chubak Q Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the potential for NII normalizing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?","Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system. But on balance net across all those various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those system-wide headwinds. So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there. But obviously, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",Steven Chubak,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746
"No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow-up in terms of your just overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, we know that story. Now, it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what kind of triggers, what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.","Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say. That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset-sensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term. But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR-type lens, a short-term NII sensitivity, but also a variety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think when you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",Glenn Schorr,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746
"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and more normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And if so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?","Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal, right? So, if you kind of build yourself out a full-year forecast and make reasonable, just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full-year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the one-time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs. That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point. And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like revenues growing at some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point, you still have some background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non-zero. There are still investments that we're executing. There's still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII. And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wrong, but that's kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors.",Matt O'Connor,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746
"Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow-up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd expect little bit of steepness of the curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.","Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a source of structural NII or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, people have different views about the so-called term premium and obviously, in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing. But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10-year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so. There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But that feels a bit speculative to me at this point.",Matt O'Connor,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746
"Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the non-interest- bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter-to-quarter versus prior quarters when they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate, if you can, what you’re seeing in that non-interest-bearing deposit account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower. But what are you guys seeing here?","Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest, I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter-on-quarter change and average non-interest-bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How are we thinking about ongoing migration of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits? And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expect that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space, you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non-interest-bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them moving those balances into interest-bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it goes into money markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yield- seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So, big picture. I do think that migration out of 12Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for NII right now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746

"Very good. And as a follow-up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge-offs and delinquency levels, and we all know about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One of the great credit quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environment? And I know your numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500 million pickup in non-accrual loans. Can you share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers are still good, but I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here over the next 12 months or so.","Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes, I agree with you, like the C&I charge-off rate has been very, very low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember correctly. I think the C&I charge-off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical standards. And while we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation. So, you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anything broader, and I haven't heard anyone internally talk that way, I would say.",Gerard Cassidy,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q2,22746
"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it was just below $94 billion. If we adjust for the one-timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below $90 billion, so pretty healthy step-up in expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year.","Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one-time type of significant items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments. And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 billion and for next year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we felt that decline wasn't big enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway. To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing and obviously we're always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the sake of argument on that base, that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing. The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount of annualization. You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you were to strip that out, you would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind. The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume-related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal, that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light. In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't changed and the plans haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long-term perspective that we've always had. I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we did used to give you the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both, well, for expenses and NII next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on NII. And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you actually go back to Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branches across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that takes bankers and certain technology, stuff like that. Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.",Steven Chubak,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2024Q3,23405
"Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow-up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at both the long end and SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I know that you've 5Steven Chubak Q Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts?","Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one. Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually a headwind to short-term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's worth saying for the broader audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to say. So, obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10-Q comes out, you'll see that that number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. That's for a number of reasons, some of which are passive, but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit. And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we certainly could. We have the capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are. And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.",Steven Chubak,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2024Q3,23405
"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow-up. As you can imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next year. So maybe a two-part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said. 6Erika Najarian Q Analyst, UBS Securities LLC Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year-over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it could be a little bit worse year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to look like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPMorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?","Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question. So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was at the conference earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a little toppy, but it's definitely in the ballpark. Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year, so you can kind of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a trough in the middle of the year, and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year. So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind. Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing. But on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so we're doing this kind of early, that's what we think. Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year. Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve, if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment. Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes out, it'll show a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have, in actuality, been lower than the modeled deposit betas. So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons, actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non-dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your question which is a little bit about the front-end versus the back-end. So, what you see is that actually the front-end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back-end. So, it's definitely the case that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front-end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind – would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts. 7",Erika Najarian,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2024Q3,23405
"Oh, yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, Sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but it is more than half your revenue so I kind of care about it. But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the build-up, QT ending, deposit growth, I mean, that's part of the calculation for improvement as we go into 2025. Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinking about it. I know we don't have a number for you for NII for 2025 but it is in there. Right?","Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer deposit balances in particular –",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q3,23405
Right.,"– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you've got balances. And balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's point. You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed-rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII, just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previously, which is there's a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom-line neutral and offset in NIR. But for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability-sensitive, so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.",Betsy L. Graseck,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q3,23405

"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin in volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin, 2.6%, down about 30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going. So I guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have. And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a tailwind could they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.","Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity, I'm going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors. And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weighted-average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably high. And that was going to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings, and/or we were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would see a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits, but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin. We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked. Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important thing to realize. So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a lower yield environment should mean that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield-seeking behavior. So then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long-term share growth in CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40 17Jeremy Barnum A Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in Consumer. Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if you're looking at, say, what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money if that happens, it's 2% to 2.5%. Absolutely. Yeah, we agree.",Saul Martinez,"Jamie Dimon, Jeremy Barnum",2024Q3,23405
"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50 basis point cut? And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow-up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.","Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly. In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle, it feels to us like right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as we speak. When you look at yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances. And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now. And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime soon, that's also a little bit supportive for deposit balances. So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the trough when that happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now. But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which point the combination of balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously. We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I think that gives you a better framework to work with.",Jim Mitchell,Jeremy Barnum,2024Q3,23405
