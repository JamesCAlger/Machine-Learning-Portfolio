"months ago they turned the showers down so they were cold,so I wasn't able to do cardio because I couldn't have a shower ,but after 6 months of complaints they turned them up so they are just bare able, but when they did that they turned the air conditioning on,bare in mind they don't put it on in the summer,but in the midst of winter they put it on and It  blows directly on to you,so as soon as your warmed up,your back cold in no time,and if your sweating it's horrendous to the point I find it hard going on the benches for a period of time,6 times I've mentioned it,its a danger to health pulling muscles and colds,I overheard 3 guys in the changing room saying they were going to try a different gym,I get the impression they are trying to loose custom so they can close it,its scruffy with poor equipment and they are constantly doing things to anger users,3 years ago I gave this gym 5 stars,but sad to say today it's 1 and deservedly so."

"In my experience, 95% of the times, the equipment is in its original place and not lying around somewhere. However, it is overcrowded most of the times, whether it's 7AM or 1PM, let alone 6pm. You get a tiny 2-3 hr window a day where it is ok."
"Around 2pm it gets overly busy with school kids who visibly just hit puberty, they are taking over an equipment and using the gym to socialise amongst themselves forever without letting others get anywhere near it. How are they even allowed in there?"

"Staff should be a lot more vigilant! Banning people for dropping weights. Banning people for dropping machinery. Banning people for not putting weights away. Since the monthly gym membership has gone up the equipment has gotten very worn and tatty. Needs repairing or replacing as if it was a new gym just opening. Gym is just lacking big time with equipment quantity in every department!  Staff need to speak up when ever any piece of equipment is not being treated properly!  Don't allow people to take dumbbells from the dumbbell area, they never get put back!  I have been a member for 6 months and am very disappointed with the gym!"
"Customer service is poor.  Staff are very unhelpful!  I had a query about the monthly fees, which I was told by staff that it was'my fault' and 'I should have read the contract'. I am a very happy customer, but the customer service is terrible. I have been a member for 2 years and am not happy at all.  I will be looking elsewhere."
"Gym facilities are poor.  Equipment is very outdated and needs replacing.  The gym should be cleaned more often, especially the equipment area.  The air conditioning is also very poor, making it uncomfortable to exercise in the gym.  The gym should be kept up to a much higher standard.  I have been a member for 2 years and I am not happy at all.  The facilities are just not good enough."

"stars because the equipment seems to always be all over the place, there are no hand sanitisers in the toilets and I only one in the whole gym. There used to be 2 cleaning stations for the equipment but recently they removed the one that was in the upper area next to the disabled wc. Very often there are buckets on the floor because of the dripping from the ceiling. It’s a shame because as a gym it has potential to be so much better. The management should look into these issues."

There is plenty of room for another one.
