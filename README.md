# Machine Learning Portfolio

A collection of machine learning projects completed as part of the Cambridge Data Science programme.

## Projects

### 1. [Customer Segmentation](customer-segmentation/)
Unsupervised learning approach to segment customers using Instacart grocery order data. Techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

### 2. [Predict Dropout Rate](predict-dropout-rate/)
Supervised learning models to predict student dropout rates using course-level data. Includes neural network implementation with Keras.

### 3. [NLP Topic Modelling](nlp-topic-modelling/)
Natural language processing project applying topic modelling to customer reviews from Google, Trustpilot, and clothing review datasets. Includes sentiment and emotion analysis using LLMs (Falcon).

### 4. [Time Series Forecasting](time-series-forecasting/)
Time series analysis for sales and demand forecasting using LSTM neural networks with hyperparameter tuning.

### 5. [Employer Project](employer-project/)
Group project analysing JPMorgan Chase quarterly earnings reports. Includes automated data extraction from PDFs and GPT-4o sentiment analysis on financial metrics (NII, ROTCE).

## Tools & Technologies
